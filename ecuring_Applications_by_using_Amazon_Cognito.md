# Securing Applications by Using Amazon Cognito

Task 1: Preparing the lab environment
Before you can work on this lab, you need to download files and run some scripts in the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) that was prepared for you.

o connect to the AWS Cloud9 IDE, from the top of these instructions, choose AWS Details.

Copy the value for Cloud9url, and paste it into a new browser tab to open the AWS Cloud9 IDE.

In a text editor of your choice (outside the AWS Cloud9 IDE), copy and paste the following text. As you work through the lab, you use this file to store information that you need in later steps:

S3 bucket: 
CloudFront distribution domain: 
User pool ID: 
App client ID: 
Amazon Cognito domain prefix: 
Identity pool ID: 
In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, in the terminal window in the bottom pane, at the voclabs:~/environment $ prompt, run the following commands to retrieve the code and install the Birds application that you use in this lab:

wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-ACACAD-3-113230/10-lab-mod9-guided-Cognito/code.zip
unzip code.zip
cd resources
. ./setup.sh

Note: After pasting the commands into the terminal, press Enter to ensure that all of the commands run.

After the setup.sh script completes, you see the last four lines of output that are similar to the following:

...
# The S3 bucket name is: 
"c42885a571457l1365962t1w991727102856-s3bucket-1s4xxypc1ttq8"
# The CloudFront distribution domain is: 
"drhx6krwefmhd.cloudfront.net"
From this output, copy and paste the following values into your text file. You need these values in later steps:

Record the S3 bucket name. The value is similar to the following: c1234567890abcdefghi-s3bucket-123456abcd3

<img width="498" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95665ad-11ed-4d00-968a-cc52f4f5b1bc" />

Record the CloudFront distribution domain name. The value is similar to the following: d123456acbdef.cloudfront.net

Next, you update the web application code to point to the node server's API endpoint.

In the AWS Cloud 9 IDE, in the explorer window to the left of the terminal, expand the website/scripts folder.

Open the config.js file.

In the file, replace <cloudfront-domain> with the CloudFront distribution domain that you recorded into your text editor.

  The updated line should be similar to the following:

<img width="621" height="189" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de1b6dc-9979-4e4e-91b1-23237d610e59" />

CONFIG.BASE_NODE_SERVER_STR = "https://d123456acbdef.cloudfront.net";
To save the file, choose File > Save.

To close the file, on the tab with the file, choose X.

Because you are using an S3 bucket to host the website, you need to upload the application files to the S3 bucket:

In the following command, replace <s3-bucket> with the name of the S3 bucket that you recorded into your text editor, and run the updated command in the AWS Cloud9 terminal:

cd /home/ec2-user/environment
aws s3 cp website s3://<s3-bucket>/ --recursive --cache-control "max-   age=0"
Because you also use the NodeJs server as part of application, you need to start the node server.

<img width="1026" height="34" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fed4870e-ce70-487a-b880-98a5a8bce42e" />

To start the node server, run the following commands:

cd /home/ec2-user/environment/node_server
npm start
   After the node server starts, you see the following output in the terminal:

> start
> REGION_STR=us-east-1 node index.js
 
Live on port: 8080
 Note: Leave the server running in this terminal window.

<img width="389" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a24f91e-7ee2-42cb-82b2-9af92c06d111" />

As part of the setup script that you ran earlier, the CloudFront distribution is being created. This distribution is used to securely deliver the contents hosted on the S3 bucket. 

Next, you check the status of the CloudFront distribution.

On the AWS Management Console, in the search box, enter and choose CloudFront to open the CloudFront console.

In the Distributions list, locate the Status column of the distribution, and wait or proceed to the next task based on the status:

If the status is Deploying, wait until the status is Enabled, and then proceed to the next task.

If the status is Enabled, continue to the next task.

<img width="1679" height="256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09abe484-0d2b-47c0-a3cc-2b98fe995942" />

## Task 2: Reviewing the Birds website
In this task, you explore the Birds web application to understand how it behaves before you enable user authentication.

In a new browser tab, enter the CloudFront distribution domain that you copied into your text file.

The Birds web application opens. The home page includes a welcome message to students.

Birds website home page.

Navigate to the BIRDS page to see pictures of birds.

For additional information, choose one of the bird pictures.

Note: These pages with bird descriptions are not protected. Anyone can get to this content.

To return to the previous page, choose BACK.

Note: You might need to scroll down to locate the BACK button.

Choose SIGHTINGS.

Note: This page requires users to log in before they can see the content.

To try the login functionality, choose LOGIN.

A message indicates that you do not have access. This message appears because the identity provider, an Amazon Cognito user pool, still needs to be set up for the application.

Choose Dissmiss.

Close the browser tab where the Birds web application is running. Keep the AWS Cloud9 IDE browser tab open, and let the node server run.

## Task 3: Configuring the Amazon Cognito user pool
In this task, you create an Amazon Cognito user pool, create users, and update the application to use the user pool.

Task 3.1: Creating a user pool
In this task, you create an Amazon Cognito user pool, which is used as the identity provider to create users and manage user passwords. The Birds web application uses the tokens generated by the Amazon Cognito user pool to help ensure that users have authenticated and have a valid session before they can access a protected page or perform a protected action. Tokens are also used to authenticate administrators and provide access to the site administrator page.

On the AWS Management Console, in the search box, enter and choose Cognito to open the Amazon Cognito console.

In the navigation pane on the left, choose User pools.

Choose Create user pool.

On the Set up your application page, configure the following options:

For Application type, ensure that Traditional web application is already selected.

For Name your application: bird_app_client

<img width="1679" height="546" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3844b731-d427-436c-907b-5700d677e908" />

Under the Configure options, choose Username

For Required attributes for sign-up, choose email from the dropdown.

<img width="1650" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb12c24e-5ff7-4834-91c1-a5bdfeae41ab" />

For Add a return URL - optional, enter https://<cloudfront-domain>/callback.html, and replace <cloudfront-domain> with the CloudFront distribution domain from your text editor.

Note: The updated URL should be similar to the following: https://d123456acbdef.cloudfront.net/callback.html

<img width="1633" height="265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/185de1c7-b8cc-45ad-bee5-f21e108c4ab6" />

Choose Create user directory

On the next page, under Check out your sign-in page, choose View login page.

Notice the Sign-in page which you will configure later, close the browser tab.

Go back to the User pools and choose the pool you created.

User pool Name should be similar to User pool - zzzzzz

On the Overview: page, you notice the pool details and other configuraiton information.

Choose Rename and under User pool name enter bird_app, choose Save changes.

<img width="1666" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef2f27b7-4698-4ef7-8037-4d9c9f81b187" />

Copy the value for User pool ID to the editor.

From the bottom Recommendations pane, choose bird_app_client link.

Go to Login pages 

On the Managed login pages configuration choose edit.

For OAuth 2.0 grant types, ensure that Authorization code grant is chosen. 

From the dropdown list, choose Implicit grant.

For OpenID Connect scopes, ensure that Email and OpenID are chosen, and clear Phone.

Choose Save changes.

<img width="1640" height="492" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6039c2b6-dd7a-4d4c-84b6-42c1059bb9cd" />

On the App client: bird_app_client page, copy the value for Client ID to the editor.

Choose Edit.

For Authentication flows, from the list, choose ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH, and UnCheck all other boxes.

<img width="1593" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c703d515-396c-41ba-ba5b-725b9b00e7a2" />

Choose Save changes.

From the pane on the left, choose Domain

From the Domain copy the part of the URL after // and before .auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com, paste it into your editor against Amazon Cognito domain prefix:.

Note: The Cognito domain should look similar to us-east-1ozkgdmcoh

Next you create and add users to the user pool.

Task 3.2: Adding users to the user pool
From the navigation pane on the left, choose Overview.

Under User management choose Users

Choose Create user.

Create a user with the following details:

For User name, enter testuser.

For Password, enter Lab-password1$.

Choose Create user.

<img width="1483" height="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c1a924-6098-42d6-8952-628c4c14c7cd" />

Create another user with the following details:

For User name, enter admin.

For Password, enter Admin123$.

Choose Create user.

<img width="1320" height="693" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686de6d0-0cd4-4ba9-b206-6ed24a4a9188" />

Note: This user has administrator permissions.

From the navigation pane, under User management choose Groups. 

Choose Create group.

On the Create group page for Group name, enter Administrators.

Choose Create group.

<img width="1596" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046c42cd-efc1-40bc-844d-93d9177d984a" />

Choose the Administrators group that you created.

Choose Add user to group.

From the list of users, select admin.

Choose Add.

<img width="1679" height="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2166b62-205a-4bb1-a514-14b2b149e855" />

Note: You have added the admin user to the Administrators group.

To return to the earlier menu, choose the Overview from the navigation pane.

Task 4: Updating the application to use the user pool for authentication
So far, you have created the Amazon Cognito user pool, configured it with information about the web application, and created a user. However, the Birds application isn't set up with authentication yet because the application doesn't know about Amazon Cognito.

In this task, you update the application to provide the information it requires to interact with Amazon Cognito. This information includes the user pool ID, application client ID, and Amazon Cognito domain prefix. 

Return to the browser tab with the AWS Cloud9 IDE.

In the terminal, to stop the node server, press Ctrl+C.

Next, you update the config.js file to add your Amazon Cognito user pool information to the website code.

In the explorer to the left of the terminal, expand the website/scripts folder.

Open the config.js file.

In the file, to uncomment the following lines of code, remove the two forward slashes (//) from the beginning of each line.

//CONFIG.COGNITO_DOMAIN_STR = "<cognito-domain>";
//CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID_STR = "<cognito-user-pool-id>";
//CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID_STR = "<cognito-app-client-id>";
//CONFIG.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRO_STR = "<cloudfront-distribution>";
In this code, replace each placeholder with the following values that you saved into your text editor:

  Note: Update the values for only the following parameters. Replace the entire string, including the brackets (<>).

<cognito-domain>: Use the value for Amazon Cognito domain prefix.

<cognito-user-pool-id>: Use the value for User pool ID.

<cognito-app-client-id>: Use the value for App client ID.

<cloudfront-distribution>: In the value for CloudFront distribution domain, use only the prefix before .cloudfront.net (for example, d123456acbdef).

The updated code should be similar to the following:

CONFIG.COGNITO_DOMAIN_STR = "abc-10-12-2021";
CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID_STR = "us-east-1_AAAA1111";
CONFIG.COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID_STR = "1a1a1a12b2b2b2b3c3c3c3c";
CONFIG.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRO_STR = "d123456acbdef";
To save the file, choose File > Save.

<img width="640" height="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/123ec364-6a49-40db-959b-fab6d631e9e4" />

Next, you push the updated website code to the S3 bucket.

In the AWS Cloud9 IDE terminal, enter the following command, and replace <s3-bucket> with the name of the S3 bucket. Run your revised command.

   cd /home/ec2-user/environment
   aws s3 cp website s3://<s3-bucket>/ --recursive --cache-control "max-age=0"
To update the node server files, run the following commands:

Note: These commands update the JavaScript packages required for the application to use the Amazon Cognito user pool, along with other configuration changes made earlier.

cd /home/ec2-user/environment/node_server
cp package2.json package.json
cp libs/mw2.js libs/mw.js
Next, you update the package.json file to add the Amazon Cognito user pool information to the node server.

In the explorer window to the left of the terminal, expand the node_server folder.

Open the package.json file.

Replace <cognito_user_pool_id> with the User pool ID from your text file.

  The updated line should be similar to the following:

"start": "REGION_STR=us-east-1 USER_POOL_ID_STR=us-east-1_AAAA1111 node index.js"
56.. To save the file, choose File > Save.

Task 5: Testing the user pool integration with the application
In this task, you test the updated application. First, you restart the node server so that it uses the updated configuration.

<img width="700" height="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa7dbced-ce09-40e4-aba3-4dd830c6c659" />

To start the node server, run the following command at the prompt:

npm start
Return to the browser tab with the Birds application, and refresh the page.

Choose SIGHTINGS.

This time, the list of bird sightings from the students in the class is not displayed.

The bird sightings are not displayed because the application is now integrated with Amazon Cognito and requires authentication!.

Note: If you get and error related to jwt, start a new browser tab or window.

Choose LOGIN.

On the prompt, provide the credentials for testuser.

Note: You may be prompted to change password.

After successfully logging in, the birds listing is displayed.

Note: If you are redirected to the Home page, navigate to the SIGHTINGS page again.

This test proves that only a user who has been authenticated by the Amazon Cognito user pool can access the protected pages of the application. The user pool centrally stores your application usernames and passwords, which makes your users and their authentication information more secure and convenient to manage. 

Choose SITEADMIN.

You see a message stating that you need to log in as an administrator to access the administration page.

If you see the message You need Admin credentials to see Admin page, choose DISMISS.

On the SITEADMIN page, choose ADMIN LOGIN.

On the login prompt, choose Sign in as a different user?

Use the admin login credentials to log in.

Note: You may be prompted to change password.

After successfully logging in, navigate to SITEADMIN page. The message Admin page under construction is displayed.

This test proves that the Amazon Cognito user pool can manage role-based access control to your application and provide secure access to the protected pages of the application based on the role. 

Task 6: Configuring the identity pool
The Amazon Cognito identity pool was created for you when you launched the lab environment. In this task, you configure the Amazon Cognito identity pool to work with the Birds application.

On the Amazon Cognito console, in the navigation pane on the left, choose Identity pools.

Choose the bird_app_id_pool link.

Copy and paste the Identity pool ID into your text editor as the Identity pool ID for use later.

From the lower pane, choose the User access tab.

Choose Add identity provider.

Choose Amazon Cognito user pool.

For User pool ID, choose the user pool with the name bird_app. 

For App client ID, choose the application with the name bird_app_client.

In the Role settings section, notice that Default authenticated role is displayed.

<img width="1665" height="663" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/704c907b-3af3-4cf6-a105-10c7d159e214" />

Choose Save changes.

Review the Authenticated access section.

Notice that the Authenticated role has been configured to use the default role, which is assigned to users when they successfully log in. You could set up additional rules to assign different AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to different users. For this phase of application development, you only keep one role assigned to the users.

Task 7: Updating the application to use the identity pool for authorization
As with the user pool, the application needs to be updated so it can interact with the identity pool. In this task, you make the necessary updates to the Birds application.

First, you update the Birds web application.

Return to the browser tab where the AWS Cloud9 IDE is open.

In the terminal window where the node server is running, press Ctrl+C to stop the NodeJs server:

Next, you update the config.js file.

In the Explorer window, expand the website/scripts folder.

Open the config.js file.

Remove the two forward slashes (//) from the beginning of the last line of code to uncomment the code, and replace <cognito-identity-pool-id>  with the identity pool ID that you saved earlier.

<img width="552" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673009a5-d1ea-480a-9c15-122d812dd459" />

To save the file, choose File > Save.

Next, you update the auth.js file.

From the website/scripts folder, open the auth.js file.

In the file, replace <cognito-user-pool-id> with the user pool ID. The placeholder is on or around line 91 in the file.

  Important: Ensure that you use the user pool ID here and not the identity pool ID.

AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
IdentityPoolId : CONFIG.COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID_STR,
Logins : {
"cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<cognito-user-pool-id>": token_str_or_null
}
});
  The updated code is similar to the following:

AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
IdentityPoolId : CONFIG.COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID_STR,
Logins : {
"cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_AAAA1111": token_str_or_null
}
});
  Note: This section of code uses the COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID_STR variable, which you set in the config.js file. The code uses this identifier to request credentials from the identity pool. Notice that this code block also passes the user pool ID and token_str_or_null, which holds the authentication token. The identity pool uses this information to verify the user in the user pool. If the user and token pass the validation, the identity pool sends AWS credentials back to the application.

To save the file, choose File > Save.

<img width="654" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715e0687-f3a7-4144-8870-edbfae3088f3" />

Next, you push the updated website code to the S3 bucket.

In the AWS Cloud9 IDE terminal, enter the following command and replace <s3-bucket> with the name of the S3 bucket. Run your revised command.

 cd /home/ec2-user/environment
 aws s3 cp website s3://<s3-bucket>/ --recursive --cache-control "max-age=0"
Ensure that the node server is still running. If it is not, run the following commands to start it again:

  cd /home/ec2-user/environment/node_server
  npm start
Task 8: Testing the identity pool integration with the application
In this task, you test the updated Birds application to ensure that you can access temporary AWS credentials. With these temporary credentials, you are able to access AWS services based on the roles that were defined when you set up the identity pool. Remember that your identity pool is configured to associate authenticated users with an IAM role that allows access to a DynamoDB table.

Return to the browser tab where the Birds application is open.

Choose HOME, and refresh the page to ensure that your browser is using the updated code.

Choose REPORT.

Choose LOGIN, and log in with the admin credentials that you created in the user pool.

Note: You may be already logged-in as admin user from the earlier steps.

Choose REPORT again as needed.

To verify that you now have access to the temporary AWS credentials that you can use to interact with a DynamoDB table, choose VALIDATE MY TEMPORARY AWS CREDENTIALS.

The application now uses the identity pool to generate temporary credentials and uses the same credentials to access the BirdSightings DynamoDB table. After successfully connecting to the database table, the application attempts to count the number of rows (0) and returns the following message: Your temporary AWS credentials have been configured.. Connecting to DynamoDB Table..BirdSightings Your Dynamodb Table has 0 rows..

This test verifies that you have correctly configured the Amazon Cognito identity pool and the application. Users who are logged in are able to access temporary credentials to communicate with the DynamoDB database.

Note: You can access the DynamoDB table from the AWS Management Console and verify that the table has 0 rows..

Conclusion
Congratulations! You now have successfully done the following:

Created an Amazon Cognito user pool

Added users to the user pool

Updated the example application to use the user pool for authentication

Configured the Amazon Cognito identity pool

Updated the example application to use the identity pool for authorization
