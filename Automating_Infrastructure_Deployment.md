A business request: Creating a static website for the café by using CloudFormation (challenge 1)
The café would like to start using CloudFormation to create and maintain resources in the AWS account. As a first attempt at this process, you take on the role of Sofía and create a CloudFormation template that can be used to create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. Then, you add more detail to the template so that when you update the stack, it configures the bucket to host a static website for the café.

Task 1: Connecting to the IDE on the EC2 instance
In this first task, you will connect to VS Code IDE and configure the environment to support the development that you will work on during the rest of the lab.

At the top of these instructions, choose i AWS Details   

Copy values from the table for the following and paste it into an editor of your choice for use later.

LabIDEURL

LabIDEPassword

In a new browser tab, paste the value for LabIDEURL to open the VS Code IDE.

On the prompt window Welcome to code-server: 

Enter the value for LabIDEPassword you copied to the editor earlier

Choose Submit to open the VS Code IDE similar to below.

Note: User Interface is displayed as shown below.

The IDE includes the following:

A bash terminal in the bottom-right panel.

A file browser in the left panel that shows files in the /home/ec2-user/environment directory on the instance.

A file editor in the upper-right panel. If you select a file in the file browser, such as the README.md file, it displays in the editor.

VS Code IDE.

Note: Keep the VS Code IDE open as you would need it for the lab steps.

Task 2: Creating a CloudFormation template from scratch
In this task, you create a CloudFormation template that creates an S3 bucket. You then run an AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command that created the CloudFormation stack. (The stack is the resource that creates the bucket.)

In the VS Code IDE, choose Menu , choose File and choose New File. Save the new file as S3.yaml.

At the top of the file, add the following two lines:

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description:
Next, add the following three lines to your file:

Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
Tip: Make sure that you keep the correct number of spaces for each indentation level. The Resources line should have no indentation. The S3Bucket line should be indented by two spaces. Finally, the Type: AWS::S3::Bucket line should be indented by four spaces.

CloudFormation supports the YAML version 1.1 specification with a few exceptions. For more information about YAML, see the YAML website.

Add a description, such as "cafe S3 template", on the Description line. Before you start your description, be sure that you have a space after the colon (:). 

After you enter the description, save the changes to the file.
```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: CAFE S3 TEMPLATE
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
```

 In the guided lab earlier in this module, you used the AWS Management Console to create a CloudFormation stack. Here, you use the AWS CLI instead.

In the VS Code IDE Bash terminal, run the following two lines of code:

aws configure get region

<img width="478" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2a815d5-9b0a-47ea-a15c-9cb74d3849fb" />

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name CreateBucket --template-body file://S3.yaml
The first line of code returns the default AWS Region of the AWS CLI client that is installed on the IDE. You can modify the default AWS Region by running the aws configure command. However, for this lab, you should leave the default Region.

The second line of code creates a stack that uses the template you defined. Because you did not specify the Region in the command, the stack is created in the default Region.  

If the create-stack command ran successfully, you should see some output that is formatted in JSON. This output should indicate a StackId.

<img width="945" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b6865e9-4b8b-4653-9462-96f569fca227" />

The following diagram illustrates the actions that you just completed.

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudFormation console, and observe the details of the CreateBucket stack.

<img width="1679" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf20cd0-9490-4d4b-b774-ddb6f9cd9bba" />

For example, look at the information in the Events, Resources, Outputs, and Template tabs.

Navigate to the Amazon S3 console to observe the bucket that your template created.

Tip: The bucket has the bucket name createbucket-s3bucket-<random-string>.

<img width="1679" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80f16dd6-46b5-4256-bc74-577347e5e5c0" />

Answering questions about the CloudFormation stack
Your answers are recorded when you choose Submit at the end of the lab.

To access the questions in this lab, at the top of these instructions, choose AWS Details.

Choose the Access the multiple choice questions link.

In the page that you loaded, submit answers to the following questions:

Question 1: Was an S3 bucket created, even if you did not specify a name for the bucket? If so, what name was it given?

Question 2: What Region was the bucket created in, and why was it created in this Region?

Question 3: To define an S3 bucket, how many lines of code did you need to enter in the 'Resources:' section of the template file?

Note: Leave the browser tab with the questions open so that you can return to it later in the lab.

Task 3: Configuring the bucket as a website and updating the stack
In this next task, you update the CloudFormation template. The update configures the S3 bucket to host a static website. This task is similar to the results from the module 3 challenge lab. In that challenge lab, you created and configured the S3 bucket manually by using the AWS Management Console. However, in this lab, you configure the bucket by using a CloudFormation template.

Next, you set bucket ownership controls and public access, and then upload the static website assets to the bucket.

To complete this task, run the following commands in the IDE Bash terminal (replace all three occurrences of  <BUCKET-NAME> with your actual bucket name):

#1. Download the website files
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-ACACAD-3-113230/15-lab-mod11-challenge-CFn/s3/static-website.zip
unzip static-website.zip -d static
cd static
#2. Set the ownership controls on the bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-ownership-controls --bucket <BUCKET-NAME> --ownership-controls Rules=[{ObjectOwnership=BucketOwnerPreferred}]
#3. Set the public access block settings on the bucket
aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket <BUCKET-NAME> --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false"
#4. Copy the website files to the bucket
aws s3 cp --recursive . s3://<BUCKET-NAME>/ --acl public-read
If these operations are successful, you should see numerous upload:<file_name> messages in the command output.

<img width="1313" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f95244e-4ece-437f-b7e9-e5e40de897a1" />

Next, you open the CloudFormation template documentation for defining S3 bucket resources.

<img width="1296" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0257857-ed74-4d84-b1fe-c07cc0d746f6" />


Go to the AWS Resource and Property Types Reference documentation.

From the Service resource type list, choose Amazon S3.

From the Resource types list, choose AWS::S3::Bucket.

By using the documentation as a reference, modify your S3.yaml template to set the following characteristics on the S3 bucket resource:

Attach a deletion policy that retains the bucket.

Configure the bucket to host a static website with index.html set as the index document.

 Tip: You can accomplish this task by adding as few as four additional lines of code to your template. See the code in the Examples section of the documentation page that you opened in the previous steps.    

To your CloudFormation template, add an output that provides the website URL.

<img width="991" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0657dfa-1da3-4692-8219-d5473b0ac358" />

Again, consult the Examples section of the documentation as a reference.

Save the changes to your S3.yaml file.

Next, you validate your template.

In the Bash terminal, change the directory back to the location of the S3.yaml file and validate your template by running the following commands.

cd ../
aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://S3.yaml
If the output indicates that your template has syntax or other errors, correct them, and then run the command again to verify that they have been resolved.

<img width="538" height="105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd2543e-f45c-4e74-ae09-9666cf3001bc" />

To update the stack, run the following command:

aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name CreateBucket --template-body file://S3.yaml
Tip: Proper YAML syntax is important. If you receive a ValidationError message when you run the update-stack command, review your use of colons and confirm that you indented each line appropriately. The example templates in the documentation provide a good reference for well-structured YAML templates.

<img width="977" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d6244e-9121-41e3-934b-919f7e27177a" />

Browse to the CloudFormation console, and confirm that your stack update completed successfully.

<img width="1154" height="255" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f31133a5-c6bc-45b5-a081-99e69c5d9d2a" />

The stack should soon show a Status of UPDATE_COMPLETE.

<img width="1046" height="211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10bd5afb-466e-45c8-819e-a8337d2392f9" />

If the stack does not attain a status of UPDATE_COMPLETE, try the following troubleshooting tips.

If you see that the stack has a ROLLBACK status of some kind, choose the Events tab, and search for an UPDATE_FAILED entry. (Read the Status reason for that event to understand why the stack update failed.)

After you think that you resolved any errors, run the update-stack command again. In the console, return to the CloudFormation stack, and choose the Events tab to confirm whether you successfully updated the stack.

Repeat as necessary.

To verify success, answer the following questions:

<img width="541" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df88cd98-4853-4e52-9d18-dd31894bcfb2" />

Does the stack's Outputs tab list an output with a URL value? If so, choose the link.

<img width="1428" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ffe8b2-61fb-465d-adc7-234815a7b95a" />

Does the static website open? (You previously copied the website assets into the bucket.)

Note: If the stack does not have any output or if the output hyperlink does not display the contents of the café website, you can try the following troubleshooting steps.

Browse to the Amazon S3 console, and choose your bucket. The Objects tab should list the index.html file and two folders that are named css and images. If these resources are not listed, revisit the first step in this challenge section.  

Choose the index.html file, and then choose Permissions. For Everyone (Public access), the value in the Object column should be Read.  

Return to the bucket view. In the Properties tab, confirm that Static website hosting is Enabled, with a Hosting type of Bucket hosting.  

All of the permissions and properties that are described in this list were either set by the AWS CLI S3 commands you ran or were set in your S3.yaml template. If necessary, adjust the details in the template and run the update-stack AWS CLI command again.

  Note: In this first challenge, you manually copied the website files into the bucket. You can also perform this action by using a custom resource from CloudFormation, combined with an AWS Lambda function. Both of these resources can be defined in a CloudFormation template. This approach is a more advanced use of CloudFormation beyond the scope of this lab. However, if you are interested in this topic, see the AWS Lambda-Backed Custom Resources page in the AWS documentation.

<img width="1458" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54336171-c597-4605-a115-5e145039ef52" />

New business requirement: Storing templates in a version control system (challenge 2)
The café team is impressed that Sofía configured an entire static website by using a CloudFormation template. Given this success, the team decided that they would like to expand their use of infrastructure as code (IaC) to build out other application resources in the AWS account.

The team understands that it is a best practice to store IaC templates in a version control system, so they asked Sofía to take on this challenge. Sofía spoke with Mateo about this new business requirement when he stopped by the café. He mentioned that CodeCommit would be a good choice for storing templates and managing version control for them. Mateo created a CodeCommit repository with some sample CloudFormation templates in it. Sofía is eager to start using this code repository.
<img width="635" height="16" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc3a14b-5509-43a4-aaf9-56dbebfee5e1" />

Task 4: Cloning a CodeCommit repository that contains CloudFormation templates
In this task, you work as Sofía to clone a CodeCommit repository. The café team will use the repository to store and control the versions of the CloudFormation templates.

Browse to the CodeCommit console, and in your account, notice the repository that is named CFTemplatesRepo.

Your CodeCommit repository should look similar to the following.

   Following image shows codecommit repository details

 CodeCommit is a source control service that you can use to host Git-based repositories. It can be used in a way that's similar to GitHub repositories. For more information about CodeCommit, see the AWS CodeCommit Documentation.

Select CFTemplatesRepo, choose Clone URL, and then choose Clone HTTPS (GRC).

 This action copies the CodeCommit repository's HTTPS (GRC) clone URL to your clipboard.

Return to Lab IDE.

To clone the existing CodeCommit repository to your workspace, enter the following command into the Bash terminal. In the command, replace <url> with the clone URL that you copied.

git clone <url>

<img width="472" height="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d7bcfd-4eb4-468e-a1c8-a645ca75bfe0" />

This command clones a copy of the CodeCommit repository that you just observed. The command creates a CFTemplatesRepo directory that should now appear in the navigation pane, which is the left pane in the IDE.

To use the Git client software to analyze your local copy of the repository, enter the following commands:

cd CFTemplatesRepo
git status
Earlier command provides the output similar to the following.

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
 
<img width="881" height="595" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73cb9eef-1bb3-4748-a577-1650bacfd157" />


The git status command shows what branch of the repository you are connected to. It also shows that your local copy is up to date with the source branch in CodeCommit.

New business requirement: Using a continuous delivery service, create the network and application layers for the café (challenge 3)
The next challenge is for Sofía to use CloudFormation to create all the network resources that the dynamic website café application can be deployed to. Then, she must deploy the café application itself.

Also, Sofía would like to find an easier way to update stacks when she updates a CloudFormation template. She is now updating templates regularly, and she thinks that she should be able to automate stack updates.

Sofía spoke with Mateo about this issue. He mentioned that CodePipeline provides the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service capabilities that she is looking for. Mateo then created two pipelines for Sofía, and she is eager to start working with them.

In this challenge, you work as Sofía and make use of these pipelines. You also define—in CloudFormation templates—all the resources that are needed to deploy the dynamic café website.

Task 5: Creating a new network layer with CloudFormation, CodeCommit, and CodePipeline
In this task, you use a CloudFormation template to create a VPC with a public subnet along with other network resources. You gain experience with using a CI/CD pipeline. When you use Git to push the template into a CodeCommit repository, it activates a pipeline that creates a CloudFormation stack.

In the navigation pane of the Lab IDE, expand the CFTemplatesRepo/templates directory.

In the templates directory, select (right-click) template1.yaml, and create a duplicate of the file.

Rename the duplicate cafe-network.yaml.

In the text editor, open the cafe-network.yaml file, and for the description, enter Network layer for the cafe, and save your changes.

<img width="1015" height="637" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7046686d-d615-4569-ab9c-81b7c56c7464" />

Observe the details of the seven resources that this template creates.

Next, you observe the CodePipeline details that were preconfigured in your account.

At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search box, enter and choose CodePipeline to open the CodePipeline console.

Choose Pipelines.

Notice that two pipelines have been predefined for you:

CafeAppPipeline

CafeNetworkPipeline

   Important: The status of the most recent attempt to run each pipeline shows that they Failed. However, this status is expected. The CloudFormation template files that the pipelines reference do not exist in their expected location.

Next, you analyze the source stage of CafeNetworkPipeline.      

To observe the pipeline details, choose CafeNetworkPipeline.

In the Source section, you can see that this pipeline's SourceAction is AWS CodeCommit.

In the SourceAction section, choose View details.

Choose Configuration.

This tab shows that the source is the CFTemplatesRepo CodeCommit repository.

To return to the CafeNetworkPipeline page, choose Done.

Analyze the Deploy stage of CafeNetworkPipeline.

Notice that the Deploy action will be performed by using CloudFormation.

In the RunChangeSet section, choose View details.

Analysis: The details on the Configuration tab show that a stack named update-cafe-network will be run or be updated. To perform these actions, the stack will use the cafe-network.yaml CloudFormation template. This Deploy action receives the template from the Source stage, which found the template in the CodeCommit repository.

The following diagram illustrates how you will activate this pipeline and what the pipeline will do. It also shows some of the AWS account resources that the resulting CloudFormation stack will create or update.

Following images shows AWS CodePipeline and various other resources such AWS CloudFormation, VPC etc.

 For more information about CodePipeline, see the AWS CodePipeline Documentation.

Return to the Lab IDE.

Next, you invoke the creation of the update-cafe-network by checking your CloudFormation template into CodeCommit.

To observe how the local copy of the repository differs from the origin, in the Bash terminal, run the following command:

git status

<img width="577" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5a7948a-04e0-4a90-ab3d-59d9caccb8b7" />

The output should show that the cafe-network.yaml file that you created is currently untracked in Git.

To add the new file to the repository and then commit it to the repository with a comment, run the following commands:

git add templates/cafe-network.yaml
git commit -m 'initial commit of network template' templates/cafe-network.yaml

<img width="599" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304dcff6-0ed7-49f2-9f1d-18a542f9ee06" />

To check the status of your local copy of the repository, run the following command:

git status
The information that is returned should report that your branch is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit.

Finally, to push the commit to the remote repository, run the following command:

git push

<img width="499" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2b99a51-5b41-4893-a5b8-05f30159594a" />

This command actually copies the file to CodeCommit.

Return to the CodePipeline console, and choose CafeNetworkPipeline.

Observe that the creation of the stack is automatically activated.

Note: It might take a minute or two for the Source stage to update and for the Deploy stage to show that it is In progress. Eventually, the Deploy stage status should show Succeeded.

Notice that the details for both Source and Deploy show the commit number that was returned when you ran the git push command. The details also show the comment that you added to the commit. 

Your Pipeline shows details similar to the following.

  Following image shows the status of the Pipeline deployment after it is deployed successfully.

Troubleshooting tips:

If the Deploy step has a status of Failed - Just now, access the error details by opening the Execution details link. For example, you could have a template-formatting error that must be resolved.

After you update the template, you can update the stack by running the appropriate git commit and git push commands again.

You can also choose Release change to activate the pipeline to run again. It does so even if you do not make changes to the CodeCommit repository (such as by issuing a git push command).

Similarly, you can use the Retry button in the Deploy stage of the pipeline. It will retry the Deploy stage without retrying the Source stage.

If the stack fails to roll back and prevents you from performing additional updates to the stack, you can delete the stack. To do so, go to the stacks page in the CloudFormation console and delete the stack. If you delete the network stack, push a new update to Git. This action activates the re-creation of the stack.

In the CloudFormation console, confirm that the update-cafe-network stack ran. It should have a Status of CREATE_COMPLETE or UPDATE_COMPLETE.

Also, check the Outputs tab for the stack. It currently shows no outputs. Soon, however, you update the stack so that it creates outputs.

Go to the Amazon VPC console, and observe that the resources defined in the cafe-network.yaml template were created in the AWS account.

For example, the console should list a VPC named Cafe VPC and a subnet named Cafe Public Subnet.

Congratulations! You have successfully created the network resources that are needed to run the café website.

<img width="875" height="522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcc98fd-0fc1-42da-b7f5-6ea4f5983d94" />

Task 6: Updating the network stack
In this task, you update the network stack so that it exports essential information about two of the resources that it creates. These two outputs can then be referenced by the application stack that you create later.

In the Lab IDE, add the following lines to the bottom of cafe-network.yaml, and save your changes.

Outputs:
  PublicSubnet:
    Description: The subnet ID to use for public web servers
    Value:
      Ref: PublicSubnet
    Export:
      Name:
        'Fn::Sub': '${AWS::StackName}-SubnetID'
  VpcId:
    Description: The VPC ID
    Value:
      Ref: VPC
    Export:
      Name:
        'Fn::Sub': '${AWS::StackName}-VpcID'
In the Bash terminal, commit the code, and then push it to CodeCommit by using Git.

Verify that the CloudFormation stack update occurs. 

Verify that the Outputs tab now lists two keys with export names.

Name	Export Name
PublicSubnet	update-cafe-network-SubnetID
VpcId	update-cafe-network-VpcID
Following image shows the output after updating the CloudFormation stack.

   Following image shows the output after updating the CloudFormation stack.

<img width="1416" height="726" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f320d3f9-d676-49e7-9435-241e829f5ee9" />

Task 7: Defining an EC2 instance resource and creating the application stack
In this task, you create a new CloudFormation template that will be used to create a stack. The new stack deploys a dynamic website for the café. The CafeAppPipeline pipeline (which you observed earlier) creates or updates the update-cafe-app stack when you push the cafe-app.yaml template to the CodeCommit repository.

In the Lab IDE, duplicate the template2.yaml file in the templates directory, and rename the duplicate cafe-app.yaml.

In the cafe-app.yaml template, analyze the existing template contents:

In the Parameters area, the LatestAmiId performs a lookup. It finds the latest Amazon Linux 2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID in the AWS Region where you create the stack. It can be referenced when you define an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.

Also in the Parameters area, the CafeNetworkParameter defines a string value. The value defaults to the name of the stack that you created when you ran the cafe-network.yaml CloudFormation template. Setting this string as a parameter provides you with the flexibility to point to a different stack name if you must reference resources in another stack.

In the Mappings area, the RegionMap mapping can be referenced when you define an EC2 instance. Using this mapping can help ensure that the correct key pair will be used for the instance. However, use of this feature depends on the AWS Region where you run the template.

In the Resources area, an EC2 security group is defined. It opens TCP ports 80 and 22 for inbound network traffic. It is created in the VPC that the update-cafe-network stack created.

In the Outputs area, an output named WebServerPublicIP returns the public IPv4 address of the EC2 instance that you define next.

Next, in the cafe-app.yaml template, you define a third parameter so that a user can choose between different instance types when they launch an EC2 instance.

In the AWS CloudFormation Documentation, in the Defining a parameter in a template section, copy the example YAML parameter.

Paste the parameter into your template, make the following adjustments, and then save your changes.

Modify the parameter so that the permitted instance types are t2.micro, t2.small, t3.micro, and t3.small. 

Change the default to t2.small.

Update the description so that it reflects the options that a user can choose.

In a new browser tab, open the AWS CloudFormation Documentation, and use the information in that page as a reference for the next steps.

In the cafe-app.yaml template, create a new EC2 instance resource with th following configuration settings:

For Logical ID, enter CafeInstance. For more information, see Resources in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

Include an ImageId that references the LatestAmiId parameter.

For InstanceType, reference the instance type parameter that you defined in the previous step.

For KeyName, use the following line of code, which references the RegionMap mapping that is already defined in the template:

KeyName: !FindInMap [RegionMap, !Ref "AWS::Region", keypair]
For the IamInstanceProfile (the AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, role that is attached to the instance), specify CafeRole.

Note: The CafeRole IAM role already exists in your account. Attaching it grants your EC2 instance the permissions to retrieve Parameter Store values from AWS Systems Manager.

In the Properties section, include the following lines of code:

NetworkInterfaces:
  - DeviceIndex: '0'
    AssociatePublicIpAddress: 'true'
    SubnetId: !ImportValue
      'Fn::Sub': '${CafeNetworkParameter}-SubnetID'
    GroupSet:
      - !Ref CafeSG
 These lines help ensure that your instance deploys to the Public Subnet that you created when you ran the café network stack. Recall that at the beginning of this task, you updated the network stack to define outputs with export names. In the preceding code, you import the value for the SubnetId. The preceding code also helps ensure that the instance you create will be in the CafeSG security group that is already defined for you in this template.

Set a Tag with a Key of Name and a Value of Cafe Web Server.

  Tip: Observe how a Name tag was applied to the security group resource that is already defined in the template.

In the Properties section, include the following additional UserData code:

  UserData:
    Fn::Base64:
      !Sub |
        #!/bin/bash
        yum -y update
        yum install -y httpd mariadb-server wget
        amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2
        systemctl enable httpd
        systemctl start httpd
        systemctl enable mariadb
        systemctl start mariadb
        wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-ACACAD-3-113230/15-lab-mod11-challenge-CFn/s3/cafe-app.sh
        chmod +x cafe-app.sh
        ./cafe-app.sh
These lines of code run on the instance at the end of the boot process. It installs an Apache HTTP web server, a MariaDB database, and PHP on the Amazon Linux instance. Next, it starts the web server and the database. Then, it downloads a script named cafe-app.sh and runs it. The cafe-app script configures the database and installs the PHP code that makes the café website function.

After you are satisfied with your template updates, save the changes. 

To validate the template format in the Bash terminal, run the following command:

aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file:///home/ec2-user/environment/CFTemplatesRepo/templates/cafe-app.yaml
If you receive a JSON-formatted response that includes the three parameters that were defined at the top of your template, then your template passed the validation. However, if you received a ValidationError response (or some other error response), you must correct the issue. Then, save the changes and run the validate-template command again.

If your template passed the validation check, add the file to CodeCommit. In the Bash terminal, run git commands to add the file, commit it, and push it to the repository.

 Tip: If it helps, refer back to the Git commands in task 3. However, remember that the name of the template that you want to push to CodeCommit for this task is different.

Return to the CodePipeline console, and choose CafeAppPipeline.

Note: It might take a minute or two for the Source stage to update and for the Deploy stage to show that it is In progress. Eventually, the Deploy stage status should show Succeeded - Just now.

If the status shows a failure, try these troubleshooting tips:

If you see that the Deploy stage has a status of Failed - Just now, choose View details to review the error information. It might provide a link that takes you to the CloudFormation stack details. Go to the Events tab to figure out which error was the first one that caused the stack to roll back.

If the stack fails to roll back, or if it has a ROLLBACK_COMPLETE status that prevents you from updating the stack with the pipeline, you can delete the stack from the CloudFormation stacks page. Then, push a new update to Git to activate the stack to be created again.

In the CloudFormation console, confirm that the update-cafe-app stack ran successfully and has a status of CREATE_COMPLETE.

In the Amazon EC2 console, observe that the EC2 instance and security group resources (which were defined in the cafe-app.yaml template) were created.

After the EC2 instance has started and passed both status checks, you test the café website. 

In a browser tab, load the following URL, where <public-ip-address> is the public IPv4 address of the EC2 instance that you defined: http://<public-ip-address>/cafe.

You should see the café website.

Tip: It can take 2 minutes or so for the user data script details that you defined to finish running. Be patient if you do not see the website immediately.

Notice that the website shows server information, such as the Region and Availability Zone where the web server is running.

Congratulations! You deployed a network layer and an application layer by using a CI/CD pipeline and an IaC approach.

Answering questions about the results of creating an application layer
Return to the browser tab with the multiple-choice questions for this lab, and answer the following questions:

Question 4: Go to the Parameters tab of the update-cafe-app stack. What value do you see for the LatestAmiId?

Question 5: Go to the Stack info tab of the update-cafe-app stack. What is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants the permissions to create and update the update-cafe-app stack?

Question 6: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CodeCommit repository where your AWS CloudFormation templates are stored. Choose Commits and in the Commits list, open one of the commits by choosing its commit ID. What you do observe?

New business requirement: Duplicating the network and application resources in a second AWS Region (challenge 4)
Sofía is pleased that she was able to create both the network layer and the application layer for the dynamic café website by using CloudFormation. Sofía also just learned that the café staff would like her to duplicate these resources into a second AWS Region, so she is even more pleased.

Sofía will soon experience the benefits of the hard work that she did to define the resources and configurations in CloudFormation templates. She will observe that it is easier to duplicate environments through an IaC approach instead of creating all the resources manually.

Task 7: Duplicating the café network and website to another AWS Region
In this final lab task, you experience how quickly you can duplicate a deployment. A quick deployment is possible because you defined all your resources in CloudFormation templates.

In tasks 4, 5, and 6, the CloudFormation stacks were created or updated automatically. A pipeline was defined to monitor when the CodeCommit repository was updated. It then invoked CloudFormation to create or update the stack. However, in this task, you use the AWS CLI to duplicate the café network resources in another AWS Region. Then, you use the CloudFormation console to create the application stack in the second Region.

In the Lab IDE, to duplicate the café network to another AWS Region, run the following command:

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name update-cafe-network --template-body file:///home/ec2-user/environment/CFTemplatesRepo/templates/cafe-network.yaml --region us-west-2
It should return a StackId. Notice that you could override the default Region for the creation of this stack by specifying the Region when you ran the command.

Browse to the CloudFormation console, and change the Region to US West (Oregon) us-west-2.

  The update-cafe-network stack should be listed.

  Verify that the status of the second update-cafe-region stack eventually changes to CREATE_COMPLETE.

  Tip: Use the  refresh icon to see the status change more quickly.

Browse to the Amazon VPC console, and confirm that you are in the US West (Oregon) us-west-2 Region.

You should be able to observe the network resources that were created.

Next, you create an Amazon EC2 key pair.

Browse to the Amazon EC2 console, and confirm that you are in the US West (Oregon) us-west-2 Region.

In the left navigation pane, choose Key Pairs.

Choose Create key pair.

For Name, enter cafe-oregon.

Choose Create key pair again.

Tip: Optionally, you can save the key pair, or you can choose Cancel. You don't need to use the key pair in this lab. However, in a typical use case, you must save the key pair; you will not have another opportunity to do so.

Revisit the application template details.

Return to the Lab IDE, and observe the cafe-app.yaml template details in the text editor.

Notice the KeyName property in the resource definition for the EC2 instance. It references the RegionMap mapping that is defined in the template.

The mapping indicates that if the instance is launched in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) Region, it should use the vockey key pair. However, if the instance is launched in the us-west-2 (Oregon) Region, it should use the cafe-oregon key pair that you just created.

Also notice the instance type parameter that you defined earlier. It provides a few instance type options in the AllowedValues area, but it also sets t2.small as the default. You use this configuration in a moment.

Next, you copy the template file to an S3 bucket.

In the Lab IDE, enter the following command. In the command, replace <repobucket-bucketname> with the actual S3 bucket name in your account. Its name should contain the string repobucket.

aws s3 cp templates/cafe-app.yaml s3://<repobucket-bucketname>/
In the Amazon S3 console, select the object that you just uploaded, and choose Copy URL to copy the object URL of the file.

In the CloudFormation console, ensure the Region is US West (Oregon) us-west-2.

Choose Create stack, and then choose With new resources (standard).

On the Create stack page, for Amazon S3 URL, enter the object URL that you just copied.

Choose Next.

On the Specify stack details page, configure the following options: 

Stack name: Enter a name.

InstanceType: Choose t3.micro.

Notice that you can set the instance type at stack creation because you defined it as a parameter in the CloudFormation template.

<img width="1413" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b73d555-2cec-4e8a-b208-8d509aaf0087" />

Continue through the remaining screens, accept all the default settings, and finish creating the stack.

Verify that the stack was created successfully.

Browse to the Amazon EC2 console and observe the created resources.

Be sure to give the web server a few minutes to finish booting and to run the user data script.

Notice the Key pair that is used by the instance and the instance type. These settings are different than the settings on the web server that runs in the us-east-1 Region. You used the same template, without modifying it, to launch this stack.

After the server has fully started, you should be able to access the website at http://<public-ip-address>/cafe where <public-ip-address> is the public IPv4 IP address of the EC2 instance.

Notice that the server information on the website shows that this second instance of the café website is running in the us-west-2 Region. The first web server that you created shows it is running in the us-east-1 Region.
